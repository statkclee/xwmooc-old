<p>Our next topic is how to control programs <em>once they&#39;re running</em>. This
is called <a href="glossary.html#job-control">job control</a>, and while it&#39;s less
important today than it was back in the Dark Ages, it is coming back
into its own as more people begin to leverage the power of computer
networks.</p>

<p>When we talk about controlling programs, what we really mean is
controlling <em>processes</em>. As we said earlier, a process is just a program
that&#39;s in memory and executing. Some of the processes on your computer
are yours: they&#39;re running programs you explicitly asked for, like your
web browser. Many others belong to the operating system that manages
your computer for you, or, if you&#39;re on a shared machine, to other
users. You can use the <code>ps</code> command to list them, just as you use <code>ls</code>
to list files and directories:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps
PID    PPID   PGID   TTY   UID     STIME   COMMAND
2152      1   2152   con  1000  13:19:07   /usr/bin/bash
2276   2152   2276   con  1000  14:53:48   /usr/bin/ps
</code></pre>

<p>Every process has a unique process id (PID). Remember, this is a
property of the process, not of the program that process is executing:
if you are running three instances of your browser at once, each will
have its own process ID.</p>

<p>The second column in this listing, PPID, shows the ID of each process&#39;s
parent. Every process on a computer is spawned by another, which is its
parent (except, of course, for the bootstrap process that runs
automatically when the computer starts up).</p>

<p>The third column (labelled PGID) is the ID of the <em>process group</em> this
process belongs to. We won&#39;t discuss process groups in this lecture, but
they&#39;re often used to manage sets of related processes. Column 4 shows
the ID of the terminal this process is running in. Once upon a time,
this really would have been a terminal connected to a central timeshared
computer. It isn&#39;t as important these days, except that if a process is
a system service, such as a network monitor, <code>ps</code> will display a
question mark for its terminal, since it doesn&#39;t actually have one.</p>

<p>Column 5 is more interesting: it&#39;s the user ID of the user this process
is being run by. This is the user ID the computer uses when checking
permissions: the process is allowed to access exactly the same things as
the user, no more, no less.</p>

<p>Finally, Column 6 shows when the process started running, and Column 7
shows what program the process is executing. Your version of <code>ps</code> may
show more or fewer columns, or may show them in a different order, but
the same information is generally available everywhere.</p>

<p>The shell provides several commands for stopping, pausing, and resuming
processes. To see them in action, let&#39;s run our <code>analyze</code> program on our
latest data files. After a few minutes go by, we realize that this is
going to take a while to finish. Being impatient, we kill the process by
typing Control-C. This stops the currently-executing program right away.
Any results it had calculated, but not written to disk, are lost.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./analyze results*.dat
...a few minutes pass...
^C
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#39;s run that same command again, with an ampersand <code>&amp;</code> at the end of
the line to tell the shell we want it to run in the
<a href="glossary.html#background">background</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./analyze results*.dat &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>When we do this, the shell launches the program as before. Instead of
leaving our keyboard and screen connected to the program&#39;s standard
input and output, though, the shell hangs onto them. This means the
shell can give us a fresh command prompt, and start running other
commands, right away. Here, for example, we&#39;re putting some parameters
for the next run of the program in a file:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat &gt; params.txt
density: 22.0
viscosity: 0.75
^D
</code></pre>

<p>(Remember, \^D is the shell&#39;s way of showing Control-D, which means &quot;end
of input&quot;.) Now let&#39;s run the <code>jobs</code> command, which tells us what
processes are currently running in the background:</p>

<pre><code>$ jobs
[1] ./analyze results01.dat results02.dat results03.dat
</code></pre>

<p>Since we&#39;re about to go and get coffee, we might as well use the
foreground command, <code>fg</code>, to bring our background job into the
foreground:</p>

<pre><code>$ fg
...a few minutes pass...
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>analyze</code> finishes running, the shell gives us a fresh prompt as
usual. If we had several jobs running in the background, we could
control which one we brought to the foreground using <code>fg %1</code>, <code>fg %2</code>,
and so on. The IDs are <em>not</em> the process IDs. Instead, they are the job
IDs displayed by the <code>jobs</code> command.</p>

<p>The shell gives us one more tool for job control: if a process is
already running in the foreground, Control-Z will pause it and return
control to the shell. We can then use <code>fg</code> to resume it in the
foreground, or <code>bg</code> to resume it as a background job. For example, let&#39;s
run <code>analyze</code> again, and then type Control-Z. The shell immediately
tells us that our program has been stopped, and gives us its job number:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./analyze results01.dat
^Z
[1]  Stopped   ./analyze results01.dat
</code></pre>

<p>If we type <code>bg %1</code>, the shell starts the process running again, but in
the background. We can check that it&#39;s running using <code>jobs</code>, and kill it
while it&#39;s still in the background using <code>kill</code> and the job number. This
has the same effect as bringing it to the foreground and then typing
Control-C:</p>

<pre><code>$ bg %1

$ jobs
[1] ./analyze results01.dat

$ kill %1
</code></pre>

<p>Job control was important when users only had one terminal window at a
time. It&#39;s less important now: if we want to run another program, it&#39;s
easy enough to open another window and run it there. However, these
ideas and tools are making a comeback, as they&#39;re often the easiest way
to run and control programs on remote computers elsewhere on the
network. We&#39;ll look at how to do this <a href="#s:ssh">later in this chapter</a>.</p>
